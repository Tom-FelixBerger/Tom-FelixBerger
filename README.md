👋 Hi, I’m @Tom-FelixBerger

____________________________________________________________________________________________

📊 I'm a PhD student in philosophy. Also, I studied Data Science (M.Sc.), Philosophy (M.A.), and Maths (B.A.)

👀 I'm excited about AI alignment, in particular mechanistic approaches to detecting and mitigating deception by LLMs.

🐒 I also work on game theoretic models of the evolution of morality.
